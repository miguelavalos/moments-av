# Moments AV Canonical Asset Handoff

Status: required before adding final App Store icon, splash, AV monogram usage,
Avi artwork, or framed screenshot assets to this public repo.

Do not use this document to approve generated, approximate, or exploratory
artwork. It is a handoff record for already-approved canonical assets.

## Current Status

No approved canonical Moments AV asset package is recorded for this public iOS
repo yet. Do not import placeholder Moments AV logo, mark, concept, or icon
files from private brand working folders as final App Store assets.

The current implementation should keep using code-level brand tokens and
system-symbol Avi placeholders until a reviewed asset package is approved and
recorded here.

## Required Rules

- [ ] App icon source is approved for Moments AV.
- [ ] Any embedded AV mark uses the canonical AVALSYS monogram.
- [ ] AV mark is small and secondary, not the primary product icon.
- [ ] Avi is not used as the app icon, product logo, or wordmark.
- [ ] Avi artwork appears only where the submitted app actually shows Avi.
- [ ] Screenshots show real release-candidate UI.
- [ ] No screenshot frame hides legal, account, credit, deletion, or export
  state copy.
- [ ] No generated or approximate AV marks are present.
- [ ] No archived/experimental Avi explorations are used as production sources.

## Verification

Before opening the asset PR:

- [ ] Compare app icon at small home-screen sizes.
- [ ] Compare App Store icon at full resolution.
- [ ] Confirm dark/light appearance where relevant.
- [ ] Confirm Reduce Transparency/Increase Contrast do not break app UI around
  the asset.
- [ ] Confirm screenshots contain no private user data.
- [ ] Confirm App Store metadata and screenshot captions match the visible UI.
- [ ] Run public readiness checks after integrating the approved assets.

```bash
scripts/check-public-release-readiness.sh
```

## Gate Update

The current public canonical asset gate is intentionally strict. When approved
assets are ready, update the gate and this handoff together so CI allows only
the approved repo paths.

Do not bypass the gate by renaming assets to avoid icon, splash, AV, monogram,
or Avi checks.
