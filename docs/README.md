# Moments AV Public Docs

This folder contains public, frontend-safe documentation for the Moments AV iOS
app repository.

Keep this repo limited to information that is safe to publish with the client
code. Product strategy, pricing, App Store review notes, promo codes, provider
choices, retention operations, model policy, revenue assumptions, and release
handoff values belong in the private AVALSYS suite.

## Included Here

- Shared Apple app pattern: Moments AV follows the public
  [Apps AV Apple Product App Patterns](https://github.com/miguelavalos/apps-av/blob/main/docs/apple-product-app-patterns.md)
  guide for Account AV, app shell, settings, config hygiene, and shared package
  usage.
- [install-ios.md](install-ios.md): local iOS setup and compile checks.
- [production-config.md](production-config.md): public runtime-config hygiene,
  with no production values.
- [release-checklist.md](release-checklist.md): public repo readiness checks.
- [release-evidence-template.md](release-evidence-template.md): non-secret
  technical evidence template.
- [canonical-asset-handoff.md](canonical-asset-handoff.md): public-safe asset
  approval record before adding final client artwork.
- [app-store-screenshots.md](app-store-screenshots.md): public screenshot safety
  rules for non-secret captures.

## Private-Only Topics

These topics must not be documented in this public repo:

- App Store Connect review notes or reviewer credentials;
- promo codes, campaign setup, or App Review access strategy;
- pricing, credit grants, margins, product policy, or RevenueCat setup;
- provider/model selection, costs, failure rates, or routing;
- backend storage, retention operations, internal URLs, or admin controls;
- legal/privacy drafts that describe internal processing beyond public policy
  links;
- unreleased product strategy or business positioning.

The placeholder files for App Store metadata, App Review notes, and App Privacy
inventory exist only to prevent accidental public planning. Their working
versions are maintained privately.

## Public Data Safety

Do not include secrets, signing material, production config, private URLs,
purchase receipts, account identifiers, selected user media, generated videos,
provider request IDs, internal logs, or demo account details in public issues,
pull requests, screenshots, or release evidence.
